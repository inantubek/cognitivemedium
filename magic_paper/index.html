      Mathematical ideas are conventionally expressed using notation
      and terminology developed using static media.  Suppose, however,
      that mathematics had been invented <em>after</em> modern
      computers. This is perhaps difficult to imagine &ndash; after
      all, mathematics helped lead to computers &ndash; but let's do
      the thought experiment anyway.  Might mathematical notation have
      developed in a different way?  Would we instead have developed a
      dynamic, interactive notation more powerful than the static
      mathematical and linguistic notations in common use today?
    </p>

    <p style="position: relative;">
      As part of my exploration of this question, I recently developed
      a simple prototype system, which I call <em>Magic Paper</em>
      (<a href="https://github.com/mnielsen/magic_paper">code</a>). To
      get a feel for what the system does, below is a video of me
      using <em>Magic Paper</em> to explain the (very simple!) basic
      idea underlying the proof of a beautiful theorem about
      artificial neural networks: the result that neural nets may be
      used to approximate any continuous
      function*<span class="marginnote" style="top: 90px">*
      See <a href="assets/Cybenko.pdf">Approximation by superpositions

      and <a href="assets/Hornik.pdf">Multilayer feedforward networks
      are universal approximators</a>, by Kurt Hornik, Maxwell
      Stinchcombe, and Halbert White (1989).</span>.  Note that you do
      not need to be deeply familiar with neural networks to follow
      along; an introduction to the basics of neural nets may be

    <p>
      The design of <em>Magic Paper</em> was inspired in part by a
      system developed by Ken Perlin, known
      as <em>ChalkTalk</em>. <em>ChalkTalk</em> has not been publicly
      released at the time of this writing (November 2017), but you
      can get some understanding of the system by viewing from 32:40
      to the end of the following video:

    <h3>Can a visual medium be used to do serious mathematical
      exploration?</h3>
    
    <p>
      I built <em>Magic Paper</em> to explore two questions not
      directly addressed by <em>ChalkTalk</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first question is whether such a visual medium can be used
      to do serious mathematical exploration, the kind a researcher
      might do when working on a research problem. In other words: can
      such a system be used as a medium for creative thought?
      While <em>ChalkTalk</em> is a fun medium to explore in, it's not
      obvious to me that it's suitable for the kind of exploration
      that arises in mathematical work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, it's too ambitious for such a quickly-built prototype
      medium to be useable across all of mathematics.  And so I
      decided to narrow the question, and ask whether such a medium
      could be used to explore at least <em>one</em> non-trivial
      mathematical question; concretely: can neural nets be used to
      approximate any function?
    </p>

    <p>
      While focusing on one problem is much easier than building a
      general-purpose exploratory mathematical medium, it's still an
      extremely demanding and thus informative constraint.
      Furthermore, it seems likely that patterns useful in solving one
      mathematical problem will be reuseable in solving others.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, even this is too demanding.  The idea for a proof
      presented above wasn't actually discovered in this medium.  It's
      a proof taken from my book on neural
      networks*<span class="marginnote">* Michael A. Nielsen,
	<a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html">Neural
	  Networks and Deep Learning (Chapter 4)</a>, Determination
	Press (2015).
      </span>. Despite this, I believe this context &ndash; explaining
      the idea underlying the proof of a relatively recent
      mathematical result &ndash; is a good one for understanding what
      is required for a general-purpose exploratory mathematical
      medium.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that while the video of <em>Magic Paper</em> perhaps makes
      it appear to be explanatory or educational in intent, that is
      not the case. It is intended primarily to be a medium to think
      and explore in, and only secondarily to explain or to educate
      in. While these goals are sometimes congruent, they are also
      often in tension.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example of this tension, explanatory media are often
      highly polished, presenting a finished product from which
      distracting elements have been eliminated.  By contrast,
      exploration involves distractions, wrong paths, and dead
      ends. One sees this in myriad small ways in the video: the
      frequent readjustment of the position and size of the glyphs;
      the various unnecessary weight and bias parameters that are
      sometimes shown; and so on.  In a polished presentation these
      would have been eliminated, showing just what the viewer needs
      at any given moment.  But such superfluous elements are
      inevitable in exploration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another example of the tension between education and exploration
      comes from the programming language Logo.  Logo is often touted
      as an example of discovery-based learning, and in many respects
      it's a good exploratory medium for mathematics.  However, while
      Logo has had considerable success in helping children understand
      ideas about differential geometry, differential geometers do
      not, as far as I'm aware, use it as a medium for research.
      That's potentially a problem: when education and real practice
      are separated, it can result in busy work on poorly-motivated
      &ldquo;educational&rdquo; problems.  An interesting project
      would be to create a single environment which can be used for
      both education and research.  I am optimistic this is possible;
      after all, beginning chess players use the same board and the
      same moves as the world champion.
    </p>

    <h3>Can we reify deep ideas about mathematics inside the <em>Magic
    Paper</em> interface?</h3>
    
    <p>
      The second question motivating <em>Magic Paper</em> was whether
      it is possible to reify deep ideas about mathematics inside the
      interface.  That sounds cryptic, but has a straightforward
      meaning. To explain that meaning, let's briefly switch topic,
      and recall an idea from elementary physics, the principle of
      conservation of energy:
    </p>

    <center>
      <p><em>&frac12;mv<sup>2</sup> + U(x)</em> = constant</p>
    </center>

    <p>
      The basic point is that there's some relationship between the
      mass of a particle, <em>m</em>, its velocity <em>v</em>, its
      position <em>x</em>, and its potential energy <em>U(x)</em>.
      The way physics is ordinarily done, we manipulate this
      expression using algebraic operations. But a different approach
      is possible. In my essay &ldquo;Thought as a
      Technology&rdquo;*<span class="marginnote">* Michael
      Nielsen, <a href="http://cognitivemedium.com/tat/index.html">Thought
      as a Technology</a>, available at
      http://cognitivemedium.com/tat/index.html (2016).</span> I
      develop a prototype interface which reifies the principle of
      conservation of energy.  In particular, the prototype vividly
      shows the user the relationship between mass, position, velocity
      and potential energy. This makes it possible to directly see and
      adjust the potential energy, see how the trajectories respond,
      and so on.  This gives a unique and rich experience, one
      enabling the user to internalize a powerful set of cognitive
      technologies for thinking about motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>ChalkTalk</em>-like media seem promising for reifying such
      principles. Unfortunately, as far as I'm aware there are no
      general results about neural networks as powerful as
      conservation of energy.  However, as a step in this direction,
      directly seeing the relationship between the parameters of a
      network and the output of various neurons does help us
      understand the behaviour of the network.  Further work could
      incorporate deeper ideas about neural networks, such as learning
      by gradient descent, or regularization, or ways of visualizing
      the network*<span class="marginnote">* A nice recent example is
      the paper by Jason Yosinksi, Jeff Clune, Anh Nguyen, Thomas
      Fuchs, and Hod Lipson,
      on <a href="assets/Yosinski2015a.pdf">Understanding Neural
      Networks Through Deep Visualization</a> ICML (2015).</span>.
      It'd also be interesting to develop such an interface in a
      context where more deep principles are available &ndash; perhaps
      using <em>Magic Paper</em> to explore (say) chaotic dynamical
      systems, using ideas such as conservation of energy,
      conservation of phase space volume, Lyapunov exponents, and the
      KAM theorem.
    </p>

    <h3>Why not just key commands?</h3>
    
    <p>
      Instead of drawing a neuron, why not just hit &ldquo;n&rdquo;?
      Instead of drawing axes, why not just hit &ldquo;g&rdquo;, for
      &ldquo;graph&rdquo;?  Wouldn't such keystrokes be faster and
      easier?
    </p>

    <p>
      This question has bothered me ever since first seeing Perlin
      demonstrate <em>ChalkTalk</em>.  Even as an audience member, I
      found it much more satisfying to see him draw a glyph than to
      just hit a key and have it appear. And this effect was even
      stronger as a user of <em>Magic Paper</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't have a satisfactory understanding of why it's satisfying
      to do this.  Perhaps it's because the act of drawing activates
      associations in my brain that wouldn't have been activated as
      strongly by issuing a key command.  In this sense, the act of
      drawing is far more meaningful &ndash; and meaning-inducing
      &ndash; than hitting a key.  It's a little like the reasons we
      don't name a variable meant to represent someone's name
      as <em>jnwhg</em>; it's more meaningful to use <em>name</em>.
      Or the reasons it's better to use a map of a coastline to
      navigate, rather than a log of latitudes and longitudes for
      points on the coast.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, while such explanations are suggestive they're
      vague and incomplete.  And yet my lived experience is that this
      is a strong effect. Something similar is true of physical
      activities, such as tennis or dance: there is an enormous
      difference between a symbolic representation &ndash; say,
      reading about tennis &ndash; versus actually doing it.  Now, for
      the most part, we tend to think of these activities as a special
      class of &ldquo;physical&rdquo; activities, different from
      &ldquo;mental&rdquo; activities such as mathematics.  Yet I'm
      not sure the distinction is all that sharp.
    </p>

    <p>
      Advocates of embodied cognition often make strong claims about
      its importance.  As far as I can see, the evidence they have for
      those claims is weak.  And yet while the specific claims may be
      weak or wrong, I believe there is some strong and important
      underlying effect.  It really does greatly help my thinking to
      sketch the glyphs in <em>Magic Paper</em>. I just don't
      understand why.
    </p>

    <h3>Extensions: abstracting glyphs, re-parameterization, glyph
    design</h3>

    <p>
      Here are three extensions that could be added to <em>Magic
      Paper</em> with 40 to 50 hours of additional work.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, it should be possible to &ldquo;lasso&rdquo; several
      elements, combining them into a single new glyph.  For instance,
      we could lasso the two-neuron gadget used to build tower
      functions, and turn it into a single re-usable glyph.  That
      abstracted glyph could then be duplicated, moved, its parameters
      edited, and so on, just as any other glyph.  It would also be
      possible to inspect the internal state of the abstracted glyph,
      making it possible to understand multiple layers of abstraction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Second, it should be possible to re-parameterize the abstracted
      glyph, so it has just three parameters, representing the height
      of the tower function, a starting <em>x</em> value, and a
      finishing <em>x</em> value.  These three parameters would then
      determine the biases and weights of the underlying elements.
      This could be implemented with a simple expression parser.
    </p>

    <p>
      Third, it should be possible to integrate an image editor
      enabling the addition of extra glyphs to <em>Magic Papers</em>'s
      visual language.  Amongst other things, such an editor could be
      used to add unique visual representations for the abstracted
      glyphs.
    </p>


    <h3>Working within the system</h3>
    
    <p>
      I began the design work for <em>Magic Paper</em> with
      paper-and-pen storyboards and a text-based script for my video.
      As I developed the storyboards and script I also began to
      develop the system.  Very quickly, the system was powerful
      enough that I could do basic sketches.  Once that point was
      reached, it was more stimulating (and easier) to work within the
      new medium, and to abandon the storyboards and script.
    </p>

    <p>
      I initially felt guilty at abandoning the storyboards and
      script, as though that was somehow the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; way
      of working.  But working in the new medium quickly began to
      suggest useful ideas that I do not believe I would otherwise
      have anticipated.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, in the final video we often see multiple graphs
      showing the behaviour of several different neurons in a network.
      This makes it easy for the viewer to understand the behaviours
      of different parts of the network, and to put it all together:
    </p>

    <center>
    <img src="assets/multiple_graphs.png" width="400px">
    </center>
    
    <p>
      By contrast, my initial storyboards and script had just a single
      output graph.  It was only after I began using the medium that I
      realized it was possible to use the graphs in this way.  In
      particular, I didn't design the system so it could plot the
      behavior of intermediate neurons.  Rather, that was a fortuitous
      happenstance, tried spontaneously as I used the medium.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another point I did not anticipate in storyboarding and
      scripting was how useful it would be to move and resize the
      neurons and the graphs, e.g.:
    </p>

    <center>
    <img src="assets/movement_edited.gif" width="400px">
    </center>

    <p>
      A big benefit of this is object persistence.  When possible,
      it's often useful to reuse or repurpose existing objects, since
      viewers have already built strong mental models of their
      behaviour. This kind of dynamic reuse is harder to achieve in
      static media. Perhaps for that reason I did not anticipate it in
      my storyboarding and scripting.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, my earlier description of this proof in an online
      book consisted of text interspersed with interactive elements,
      e.g.:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/nnadl_4_pt1.png" width="50%"><img src="assets/nnadl_4_pt2.png" width="50%">

    <p>
      Many of the interactive elements depict minor variations on the
      same system.  But because there is no object persistence, the
      user must parse each one separately, and put in the mental work
      required to understand the relationships.  For the most part
      this is not terribly hard work, but it is an additional mental
      burden.
    </p>

    <p>
      All told, while the script and storyboards were useful to
      bootstrap, once the medium was running, it was more generative
      to work directly within that, experimenting and evolving an
      approach I was comfortable with.
    </p>

    <h3>Why exploration of new media forms is often not viewed as
      &ldquo;serious&rdquo; work</h3>

    <p>
      Within science and mathematics the exploration of new media
      forms is often not treated as serious work.  This is related to
      my earlier observation, which is that such work is often viewed
      as primarily educational.  Unfortunately, within the sciences
      education is often viewed as second-rate work.  As George
      Bernard Shaw's famous line has it: &ldquo;He who can, does. He
      who cannot, teaches.&rdquo; This is, of course, ridiculous
      &ndash; I am reporting it as a common position, not agreeing
      with it!  But I believe such sentiments underly the reasons why
      work experimenting with new media is often considered as
      &ldquo;merely&rdquo; unimportant educational work.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, I believe this connection to education and explanation
      is a major reason exploration with new media is so important.
      The new medium forces us rethink the most fundamental parts of
      science and mathematics.  Much advanced research work concerns
      esoteric subjects.  But people working on new media forms have
      the opportunity to rethink how absolutely fundamental concepts
      such as number, equality, and so on.  They are rethinking what
      mathematics and language is.  I believe these experiments will
      eventually affect and perhaps transform the way all research is
      done.  But it will take a huge effort, since this is not an
      individual-sized problem.  It's a civilization-sized problem.
